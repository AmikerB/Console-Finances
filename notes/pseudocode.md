# Week4 Challenge

1. find function to workout total number of months in dataset -maybe somthing where it finds repeat months then counts how many are not repeats?
2. net total - add all together
- can also find total for each year if want to do something extra 
3. net losses - add all minus together
4. may need to find differences between the months (difference between month and previous month) and then divide that by number of months - create new array with the changes 
6. largest increase in profits - biggest value
5. smallest decrease in profits - smallest value
- .sort to sort elements to find smallest and largest value or use for loop to find biggest and smallest value. 

- numbers in example may not be correct 

for month of january make changes 0
